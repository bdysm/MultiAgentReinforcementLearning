Data Science User Case: 

A.I. decision advantage intelligence model 

definition: Within intelligence circles, achieving decision advantage requires greatly accelerated tasking, collecting, processing, exploiting, and dissemination of operationally useful information that informs timely decisions at all levels of the joint operating forces and government.

Decision advantage is what results when intelligence enables a decision-maker to better understand and address an issue. It requires:

1) Intelligence that is timely, accurate, and relevant to a given issue and;

2) At least one decision-maker who possesses the expertise and resources needed to evaluate and action the intelligence within the context of the issue.

Model Definition: Most models are wrong but some AI models are useful in adaptive and changing global environment

# State space (S): A state is a representation of the environment. The state space is the set of all possible states. Action space (A): The set of all possible actions the learning agent can take in the environment.

A state space forms a graph in which the nodes are states and the arcs between nodes are actions. In the state space, a path is a sequence of states connected by a sequence of actions. The solution of a problem is part of the graph formed by the state space.

A state space model (SSM) posits a set of latent (unobserved) variables that evolve over time with dynamics specified by a probabilistic transition model p(z[t+1] | z[t]). At each timestep, we observe a value sampled from an observation model conditioned on the current state, p(x[t] | z[t]). The special case where both the transition and observation models are Gaussians with mean specified as a linear function of the inputs, is known as a linear Gaussian state space model and supports tractable exact probabilistic calculations; see tfp.distributions.LinearGaussianStateSpaceModel for details.

A game theoretic framework for incentive-based models of intrinsic motivation in artificial systems #reward #action #play # epsidoes #simulations

An emerging body of research is focusing on understanding and building artificial systems that can achieve open-ended development influenced by intrinsic motivations. In particular, research in robotics and machine learning is yielding systems and algorithms with increasing capacity for self-directed learning and autonomy. Traditional software architectures and algorithms are being augmented with intrinsic motivations to drive cumulative acquisition of knowledge and skills. Intrinsic motivations have recently been considered in reinforcement learning, active learning and supervised learning settings among others. This paper considers game theory as a novel setting for intrinsic motivation. A game theoretic framework for intrinsic motivation is formulated by introducing the concept of optimally motivating incentive as a lens through which players perceive a game. Transformations of four well-known mixed-motive games are presented to demonstrate the perceived games when players' optimally motivating incentive falls in three cases corresponding to strong power, affiliation and achievement motivation. We use agent-based simulations to demonstrate that players with different optimally motivating incentive act differently as a result of their altered perception of the game. We discuss the implications of these results both for modeling human behavior and for designing artificial agents or robots.

Game theory is basically a branch of mathematics that is used to typical strategic interaction between different players (agents), all of which are equally rational, in a context with predefined rules (of playing or maneuvering) and outcomes. Every player or agent is a rational entity who is selfish and tries to maximize the reward to be obtained using a particular strategy. All the players abide by certain rules in order to receive a predefined playoff- a reward after a certain outcome. Hence, a GAME can be defined as a set of players, actions, strategies, and a final playoff for which all the players are competing.

Unsystematic risks are often specific to an individual AI model risk, MLOps company, due to their management, financial obligations, or location. Unlike systematic risks, unsystematic risks can be reduced by diversifying.

Putting it AI together: AI secrets [ Psss ] 

Answering 3 of the most fundamental ML/AI questions:
1) A.I. can replicate closely any function including complex non-linear functions, making it possible to replicate any kind of output (Reinelt et al., 2002). 
2) The predicted output can be decomposed y^ into xai model weights.
3) AIgorithm w ∗ (k) is verified by a decision maker it follows computational intelligence model predictions must be verified by a human agent i.e., the decision maker (Hawking, 2015) #intelligence
