 Investment Portfolio Modeling using NN Artificial Agent's Architecture and Global v Local solutions
- State Space control architecture application using Wavelon Network, DAG for Reinforcement Learning 
- Predictive feature vector Weight collaborative filtering ERS
- Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning Collusion AI Game Theory based on the union of interests between multi-agent systems that need dependable appropriated bases using Reinforcement Learning.
- Agent collaborative passive open loop , active closed loop reinforcement learning 
- Artificial Agent: Identify, Assess, Monitor, Control, Evaluate, Learn, Adapt IAMCELA
- Extended Kalman Filter Receding Horizon Control Predictive - Mean Variance Optimization 
- Portfolio Engine Recommendation AI System based on SSRFMPC 
- Tracking Error Volatility Metric Cost Function Portfolio Optimization
- Idiosyncratic Systemic Risk Game Theory XAI
XAI Tracking error converges to the global financial system reference trajectory due to control law algorithm initialization, the tracking error is state system error. The signals in the closed-loop are bounded.
- Volatility reflects the overall risk of the Portfolios expected return and is directly attached to the index volatility, the TE presents an additional risk measurement
-Predictive global asset ï¬‚ows and shifts in economic cycles require an on-line adaptation of the model internal structure (Qi and Brdys, 2008; Qi and Brdys, 2009) and a recursively feasible Tracking Error.
