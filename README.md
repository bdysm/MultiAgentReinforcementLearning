# State space (S): A state is a representation of the environment. The state space is the set of all possible states. Action space (A): The set of all possible actions the learning agent can take in the environment.

A state space forms a graph in which the nodes are states and the arcs between nodes are actions. In the state space, a path is a sequence of states connected by a sequence of actions. The solution of a problem is part of the graph formed by the state space.

A state space model (SSM) posits a set of latent (unobserved) variables that evolve over time with dynamics specified by a probabilistic transition model p(z[t+1] | z[t]). At each timestep, we observe a value sampled from an observation model conditioned on the current state, p(x[t] | z[t]). The special case where both the transition and observation models are Gaussians with mean specified as a linear function of the inputs, is known as a linear Gaussian state space model and supports tractable exact probabilistic calculations; see tfp.distributions.LinearGaussianStateSpaceModel for details.

XAI Tracking error converges to the global financial system reference trajectory due to control law algorithm initialization, the tracking error is state system error. The signals in the closed-loop are bounded.
- Volatility reflects the overall risk of the Portfolios expected return and is directly attached to the index volatility, the TE presents an additional risk measurement
-Predictive global asset ﬂows and shifts in economic cycles require an on-line adaptation of the model internal structure (Qi and Brdys, 2008; Qi and Brdys, 2009) and a recursively feasible Tracking Error.
-	Using Global Cloud AI model development with open-source software reduces AI model risk development, deployment, and ensures CI/CD Integration, Deployment, Delivery	

-	Local Unsystematic risk refers to AI model risk that are not shared with a wider market or industry. Unsystematic risks are often specific to an individual AI model risk, MLOps company, due to their management, financial obligations, or location. Unlike systematic risks, unsystematic risks can be reduced by diversifying.

Putting it ai together: 

Answering 3 of the most fundamental ml/ai questions:
1) A.I. can replicate closely any function including complex non-linear functions, making it possible to replicate any kind of output (Reinelt et al., 2002). 
2) The predicted output can be decomposed y^ into xai model weights.
3) AIgorithm w ∗ (k) is verified by a decision maker it follows computational intelligence model predictions must be verified by a human agent i.e., the decision maker (Hawking, 2015) #intelligence
Hawking, S. (2015).
